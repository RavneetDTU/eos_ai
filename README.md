## Introduction

The proposed project involves developing a generative AI assistance bot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 technology, fine-tuned on EOS public data. It is important to note that this is not a prompt engineer but an advanced AI model specifically designed for EOS blockchain users.

Unlike the current ChatGPT, EOSAI will provide detailed information about EOS Stake-Based Voting & Rewards, thanks to its training on EOS public data. Similarly, EOSAI will excel in integrating EOS Chain APIs into users' code bases and offer debugging support after code implementation, which may not be feasible with the current ChatGPT. Training EOSAI on EOS documentation and codebase will enable it to possess these advanced capabilities.

By combining the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 technology, fine-tuned on EOS public data, with a three-phase implementation strategy, this project aims to create an advanced AI bot tailored specifically for the EOS blockchain ecosystem. EOSAI will serve as a comprehensive resource for users, addressing queries and facilitating development on the EOS chain, while incorporating a sustainable token-based payment system to support its computational requirements.
